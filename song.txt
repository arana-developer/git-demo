Open up your mind, and let me step inside
Rest your weary head, and let your heart decide
It's so easy when you know the rules
It's so easy, all you have to do is fall in love
Play the game
Everybody, play the game of love, yeah
When you're feeling down, and your resistance is low
Light another cigarette, and let yourself go
This is your life, don't play hard to get
It's a free world, all you have to do is fall in love
Play the game
Everybody, play the game of love, ooh, yeah
